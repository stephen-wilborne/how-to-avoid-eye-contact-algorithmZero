## How to Avoid Eye Contact: algorithm-Zero

There are three required steps, in order to complete this algorithm. 

They are fairly open, yet rigidly enumerated, owing to the Core Responsibility.

The Core Responsibility is to comport with reason, scientific rigor, accuracy, and amenability to scrutiny through Open Peer Review.

## How to Avoid Eye Contact -- TL;DR

* Greetings! There are those who will want to skip past most of this, and get to the part that just boils it all down to the most simplest form, so as not to waste my effing time!

## How to Avoid Eye Contact -- The Three Books

### Step 0:

The goal of step zero is to commit to a trilogy of books that will allow one to subsume the narratives of the Bible. 

This particular step is admittedly skewed toward the terminology and nomenclature associated with the [[ Atheism/Christanity + Favorable/Unfavorable ]] variant of the four-winds cognitive manifold. 

As such, the reader is invited to revisit this step at any time, should any doubt arise as to the authenticity or commitment of its author(s), to the task(s) now at hand.

With that, it is perhaps beyond crucial to pay proper recognition to the ever present role of :

* 0a) singular-heart; 
* 0b) singular-eye; and 
* 0c) singular mind. 

There is a mission and a field at hand, with no intention of wasting it or losing progress, after all.

Which brings us to step 1.

### Step 1:

* 1a) Choose a religious book.
    * In this case we chose the Bible, owing to the requirements and constraints of algorithm Zero//step zero.
   
* 1b) Find a copy of a "fair repudiation" of your chosen "religious" book
   * in this case we also choose the Skeptics Annotated Bible as the fair repudiation of our religious book

* 1c) Take out all the excerpts and references, where the fair repudiation acknowledges something favorable about the religious book or its proper application
   * in this case, we take all the sections of the Skeptic's Annotated Bible marked as "Good stuff in the Bible"
