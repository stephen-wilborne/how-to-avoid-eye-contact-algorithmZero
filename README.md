## How to Avoid Eye Contact: algorithm-Zero

There are three required steps, in order to complete this algorithm. 

They are fairly open, yet rigidly enumerated, owing to the Core Responsibility.

The Core Responsibility is to comport with reason, scientific rigor, accuracy, and amenability to scrutiny through Open Peer Review.

* Note: this particular algorithm is admittedly skewed toward the terminology and nomenclature associated with the [[ Atheism/Christanity + Favorable/Unfavorable ]] variant of the four-winds cognitive manifold. As such, the reader is invited to revisit this acknowledgement, should any doubt arise as to the authenticity or commitment of its author(s), to the task(s) now at hand.


## How to Avoid Eye Contact -- TL;DR

* Greetings! There are those who will want to skip past most of this, and get to the part that just boils it all down to the most simplest form, so as not to waste my effing time!

## How to Avoid Eye Contact -- The Three Books

### Step 0:

The goal of step zero is to commit to a trilogy of books that will allow one to subsume the narratives of the Bible. 

Throughout one's missions in this particular field (the one envisioned by the author of this algorithm [let the reader understand]) it becomes increasingly straightforward to comprehend the dark sayings of those enmeshed in the field of Atheist/Christianity double-agency.

Nevertheless, it is perhaps beyond crucial to pay proper recognition to the ever present role of 

* 0a) singular-heart; 
* 0b) singular-eye; and 
* 0c) singular mind. 

There is a mission and a field at hand, with no intention of wasting it or losing progress, after all.

Which brings us to step 1.

### Step 1:



* 1a) 
   Choose a religious book. In this case we chose the Bible, owing to the requirements and constraints of algorithm Zero//step zero.
   
* 1b) 

   Find a copy of a "fair repudiation" of your chosen "religious" book
   * in this case we choose The Bible for the religious book
   * in this case we also choose the Skeptics Annotated Bible as the fair repudiation of our religious book


    Take out all the excerpts and references, where the fair repudiation concedes there is actually something worthwhile in the religious book.
   * in this case, we take all the sections of the Skeptic's Annotated Bible
